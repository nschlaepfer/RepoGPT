# GitHub Repository Analyzer

## Objective

The software solution aims to clone a GitHub repository provided by the user, and subsequently perform one of the following actions based on user input:

1. Convert the code into embeddings and upload to a Pinecone database.
2. Comment all files, create a README, and a file structure guide for the code in the repo.
3. Execute both steps 1 and 2, commenting first, and then uploading the embeddings.

## Intended Users

The intended users are developers or researchers who want to analyze or understand code from a GitHub repository, either by viewing well-commented code and a clear file structure guide, or by leveraging code embeddings in a Pinecone database for machine learning tasks.

## Requirements

- Programming Language: Python (as it has good support for text processing, Git operations, machine learning, and interfacing with Pinecone).
- External libraries: GitPython (for Git operations), some NLP library like spaCy or Transformers (for creating code embeddings), Pinecone (for uploading embeddings).

## Software Architecture

The software will follow a modular architecture for ease of maintenance and scalability, divided into these main modules:

1. User Interface: For getting user input.
2. Git Operations: For cloning the repo and manipulating the files.
3. Code Processing: For commenting the code and creating the file structure guide.
4. Embedding Generation: For converting the code into embeddings.
5. Pinecone Operations: For uploading embeddings to Pinecone.

## Workflow

The software will follow this general workflow:

1. Ask the user for a GitHub repo link.
2. Clone the GitHub repository.
3. Ask the user for their desired operation (1, 2, or both).
4. Depending on user input, perform the necessary operations.

## Data Security

As the system might be dealing with potentially sensitive code, it will follow best practices for data security including ensuring secure communication with the Pinecone database.

## Maintenance and Updates

Regular updates will be necessary to ensure compatibility with the latest versions of the various libraries and services being used. Additionally, depending on user feedback and usage patterns, new features or improvements might be required.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (pip install gitpython spacy transformers pinecone-io).

## Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory.
2. Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to `main.py`. On a Unix-like terminal, type `export FLASK_APP=main.py`. On Windows command prompt, type `set FLASK_APP=main.py`.
3. Run the Flask server with the `flask run` command.
4. Open your web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to view and interact with your application.
